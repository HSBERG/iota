# what is iota?
iota is a decenteralized intranet for students. everything is compiled here for a raspberry pi 2b and onwards. I am not the creator of the projects used in this. all credits go to them. 

 ANY PROJECTS ADDED TO THIS WILL BE CREDITED IN THE README.MD
 
 
 current objectives are to have an office twitter-like social media, archives of popular pages for educational value, and a chat network. This hopefully will also have other capabilities like user made archives for things.
